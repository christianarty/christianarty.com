Hello! First of all I want to say thank you for looking at my page. It means a lot that you're giving me your time and reading my blog! I'll keep this post short and try my best _not_ to bore you to tears!

As you already saw on the homepage, my name is Christian. In this blog, my goal is to try to create content that is easy to understand and educational; I want to help break down complicated technological topics into smaller, bite-sized ones. In these articles, I will also give explanations and little guides as to how to do it. It will be a learning experience for both of us! So, I'll **try** to make an informative post every month, but will try to post more often whenever I can, so please stay tuned and subscribe to my RSS feed. Since this is the first blog post, the new technology I'm going to be talking about is... me!

I am a recent Stony Brook alumnus. I majored in Biology and minored in Computer Science and, as of right now, I am a software developer at Full Stack Devs, LLC. Yes, I know. It is way off from what I majored in, but it goes to show you that if I can do it, anyone can. I am always trying to better myself and improve my skills. I was born and raised in New York (:musical_note:...the place where dreams are made of. Here in New -- :musical_note: Alright I'll stop), specifically Long Island. I mainly do web development with React and Node. Technology is a rapidly evolving field and I'm excited each and every day about all the new releases with new and trending technologies. Here is something I like to go by:

```javascript
while (noSuccess) {
  tryAgain()
  luck++
}
```

My programming language of choice is Javascript, but I am also comfortable programming in Python. I primarily develop in a macOS environment, but I also switch to my linux machine from time to time. For most of my free time, I like expanding my knowledge, so I often explore the web and read many articles from websites like Medium and Reddit, ... but sometimes I'll be scrolling through memes :see_no_evil:.

If you want to contact me, you can email me or connect with me on LinkedIn. The links are on the header above. Thanks for reading!
