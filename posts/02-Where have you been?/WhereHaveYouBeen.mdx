Wow. Took you around, what six months to make another post? Well, I was busy with some stuff and just didn't have the time to devote to a blog. Well, here's to tell you that... nothing has changed except my time management. So, I'm going to keep this post nice and sweet and even just give you bullet point updates

- Rebuilt this website from scratch using Gatsby instead of Jekyll
  - I felt that on the last version of this website, I didn't have much control over the styling and layout and I really wanted to learn Gatsby
- Strayed away from Python and more into Javascript
  - Additionally, I felt that python was geared for more data analysis and scraping tasks. Python is a great general purpose language, but after coming across the web and various web technologies. I quickly switched my focus onto Javascript and Node. I just like working in the web :shrug:
- I've learned a lot since my last post

  - These past couple months have been a learning process and my brain has been a literal sponge. I've been learning the in's and out's of javascript and devoting most of the day, trying out side projects, trying algorithm and data structure practice and more. But speaking of data structures...

### What's Next?

Well. I plan on updating this site a whole bunch more. Not only adding new features/ stylistic elements, but also starting a data structures blog series, really explaining in my terms :see-no-evil: how these structures are done (and trying to include code samples too)

So hopefully (...whoever is out there), there will be a helpful DS blog guide for y'all. Hope you like it!
